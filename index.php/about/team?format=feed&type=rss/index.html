			<description><![CDATA[<p>Naveen Agrawal is an organizer with Public Bank Los Angeles and the California Public Bank Alliance. He comes to the movement from his work in affordable housing development -- an industry that depends on private finance to provide a public, human right. He views public banking as an opportunity to change how our city provides for generations to come. He's also an avid cyclist and has high hopes for a city blanketed in green space and bike lanes.</p>]]></description>
