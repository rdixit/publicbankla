It was allowed to lend only to businesses that had been turned down by other banks; in other words, they were bad credit risks. The Bank of North Dakota (BND), our one and only publicly owned depository bank, is extremely profitable – more profitable than Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, according to the Wall Street Journal – and it does not make bad loans. It is very risk-averse, lends conservatively, does not gamble in derivatives or put deposits at risk. It is able to lend at lower than market rates because its costs are very low. It does not pay bonuses or commissions, has no high paid executives, and has no shareholders bleeding off profits in the form of dividends. It does not have branches. It does not compete but partners with local banks, which act as the front office dealing with customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BND does make loans that community banks are unable to service, but it is not because the borrowers are bad credit risks. It is because either the loans are too big for the smaller banks like the BND, would be run by seasoned bankers fully mindful of credit risk, interest rate risk and quality of assets. Public sector banks, while rare in the US, are common in other countries; and recent studies have shown that like the BND, they are actually more profitable, safer, less corrupt, and more accountable than private banks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

If the city wants to issue a bond, they could do that as they normally would through a private commercial bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could start with infrastructure. The internal financing of bonds will reduce costs associated with public finance. In the public bank license draft there is a prohibition on offering commercial credit directly to businesses. Commercial loans would be done in partnership with community banks which gets away from risk of doing business loans that shouldn’t be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loan portfolio will fund sectors of the economy that were previously undervalued by Wall St. bankers to stimulate the local economy resulting in higher tax revenue for the city, and its scope would be limited to the region, making us more competitive as a lender in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The public bank license would give statutory authority to address these issues. We would create this statute which would underpin how we start the public bank and address the challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. Bonds.&lt;/strong&gt; The city could still sell bonds on the existing market if those rates are the cheapest. The public bank would actually seek to participate in the early series of municipal bonds (year 1 - 5) to shore up their portfolio with high grade collateral and to maintain liquidity. The bank could be designed to have a bond broker department that directly serves its municipality and charges drastically less for origination of bonds, to make access to credit a more mundane city function (which it already should be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bank could also provide alternative credit options to a city at far below the bond market rate (4-6% by borrowing at the federal funds rate (0.4%) and making preferential loans directly to city projects. This is especially advantageous on infrastructure improvements like transportation, power and trash which have revenue streams that can pay down loans at a predictable rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bank would also provide fiscally and socially responsible investment options to city investment and pension funds to help them balance their riskier investments while still earning a strong return on investment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d.

Like the Green Bay Packers model, contributions are donations, so the city would continue to own 100% of equity. The size of the equity base of the bank would determine the size of its lending portfolio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-voting shares of the public bank could be sold at its founding, with a strict limit on the number of shares available per natural person residing in the region. This could guarantee a low-cost buy-in for all LA residents, it would prevent a rush on shares by large corporations and investors, and it would create a sense of public ownership above and beyond the city’s sole executive shareholder status. Each share could even represent a citizen account/certificate of deposit at the bank which could receive limited dividends and interest, further expanding the lending capacity of the bank while setting aside a small investment for the future of every individual Angeleno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be ascertained more accurately by a well-researched business plan that can outline different alternative given various assumptions. The major milestone would be for the business plan to be prepared to give the answer of where the money will come from and what the costs will be.
